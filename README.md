# ABC
Library of trajectories for performing ABC in various systems.

Each .zip contains the library for the respective system.

In each subsequent .csv file, the columns represent a trajectory, while the numbers in the rows are the wait time (in units of cavity decay rate) until the next photon emission.

Description of physical systems and parameters taken can be found in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00724
